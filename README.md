# Te-Reo-Maori-Quiz-Assessment
This program I've created is run as a console application and is a multichoice quiz on the Te Reo Maori language, in this  quiz there are 15 levels with 15 more optional levels. They are shown a different Maori word and different English word choices on each level.

The user is to type in one of the following English words. If they type in the correct word they gain 2 points towards their total score and proceed to the next level till they finish 15 levels.

If the user types in one of the following English words but, they’re incorrect. They’re to type in a word again until they’ve typed in the correct word. 1 point is deducted from their score for every incorrect word, unless they’ve got a score of 0.

If the user types “-1” anytime during the quiz, the program stops and displays their current score/(30 or 60) depending on if they typed “-1” during the first or second part of the quiz.

If the user types “menu” during the quiz, it clears previous text and tells the user they’ve entered the main menu and are given the option to type “-1” to exit or enter any key to resume

When the user completes 15 levels they are shown their total score and are given an option. Do another 15 levels or quit. If the user proceeds to do another 15 levels, the process repeats once more with a different Maori word and different English word choices on each level. If the user quits, the program is closed.

To use the program the key requirement is a keyboard as the user only needs to type
